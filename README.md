❓ How it works?
**It is very easy to use. Open it and you will find a web window of the original PCPartPicker site, directly in the list part. Choose your components and, once finished, click on "Save a configuration". Enter the build code (the one you find in the screenshot below) and click OK. Then give your configuration a name (so that if you have more than one it will be easier for you to recognize the one you are interested in). Now, if you want to reload a configuration that you had previously saved, click on "Load a configuration" and enter the build code provided from the list of your saved configurations (the list works in the format "Build code - Build name"), and it will load on the browser web application the required configuration. Finally, if you no longer need a configuration, or you made a mistake in typing its build code, click on "Delete a configuration" and enter the build code of the configuration to delete ❗ATTENTION: ONCE A CONFIGURATION IS DELETED IT WILL NO LONGER BE POSSIBLE FIND IT IF NOT RESCUING IT❗
